> Request wrapper core for consuming third party services

Whenever you need to communicate with third party API to get or save data from own codebase, you would have to perform a set of common steps such as login, query, etc.
Trembita.js is doing the same by abstracting the innards of the actual REST calls to third-party API and exposing only the developer relevant details.
Trembita.js supports plugins which are API connectors that are exposing methods for API communication. Each plugin is describing another third-party service. It performs these commonly used functions - creates requests, parses responses, handles errors etc.

The goal of this module is not only to provide you with a simple interface but the implementation of commonly used tools out of the box. This is a core module to reuse with plugins each for a different third-party service.
