> Request wrapper core for consuming third party services

Whenever you need to communicate with third party API to get or save data from
own codebase, you would have to perform a set of common steps such as login,
query, etc. Trembita.js is doing the same by abstracting the innards of the
actual REST calls to third-party API and exposing only the developer relevant
details. Trembita.js supports plugins which are API connectors that are exposing
methods for API communication. Each plugin is describing another third-party
service. It performs these commonly used functions - creates requests, parses
responses, handles errors etc.

The goal of this module is not only to provide you with a simple interface but
the implementation of commonly used tools out of the box. This is a core module
to reuse with plugins each for a different third-party service.

Trembita API wrapper plugin lets you call itself instead of the API directly.
Well what happens if you want to change from one API to another? Now you have 
to rewrite ALL of your code. If you used a wrapper then all you have to do is
change the wrapper and you are done.

## Install

Using npm:

```
npm install trembita
```

Using yarn:

```
yarn add trembita
```

## Usage

Trembita is not supposed to be used directly, rather than to develop plugins/clients.

In order you can use a third party service by implementing your plugin, make
sure you fill the next requirements:

- Extend Trembita module.
- Construct the plugin by implementing the properties inherited from Trembita
  module.
- Define the methods that contains the logic that expose third party library
  logic you want to use.

One example of usage would be:

```javascript
const clientOptions = {
  headers: {
    header1: 'xxx',
    header2: 'yyy'
  },
  endpoint: 'http://serviceapi.com'
};

const MyAPIClient = class MyAPIClient extends Trembita {
  constructor(options) {
    super(...arguments);

    this.getData = paramsQueryString => {
      const params = {
        url: `api/path/`,
        qs: paramsQueryString,
        expectedCodes: [200, 401, 403, 404],
        headers: {
          header1: this.header1,
          header2: this.header2
        }
      };
      return this.request(params);
    };
  }
};

const client = new MyAPIClient(clientOptions);
```
